# Week_3 - Florida Crime Statistics
## Authored Alex Lopez & Katherine Granados
This project analyzes Florida Crime Reporting data from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
through two reporting sources: The Florida Convictions History Dashboard and 
the Florida Incident-Based Reporting System. 

For the datasets, we used the 2023 FIBRS Report and the FLDE Conviction data from 
2019 to 2023

We wanted to answer the following questions: 
- Was Miami-Dade County among the top 10 counties with most occuring crime incidents?
- Was there a significant drop off in crime in 2020, coinciding with Covid-19 Lockdown,
  with a trend upwards back to or above 2019 levels.
  
We analyzed the data through these criteria:
- Counties with the most incidents over the past 5 years (FDLE)
- Most common reported crime incidents over the past 5 years (FDLE) 
- The top reported type of crime incident per year in each county (FDLE)
- The most common grouped types of crime incidents across Police Departments 
  in Miami Dade County (FIBRS)

In our analysis, we concluded that Miami-Dade was in the top 10 but was lower 
than other counties such as:
- its neighbor Broward County (9)
- The Tampa Bay Aread Pinellas(1) & Hillsborough Counties(2)

We also saw that while there was a dropoff in reported incidents in 2020, 
There was a **Downward** trend after 2021 and 2023 had the fewest reported incidents.
which indicates that 2023 is notable for having the lowest recorded criminal incidents 
in recent years
